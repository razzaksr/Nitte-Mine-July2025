Great question — and you're right to be concerned. If you're getting:

* **Test Case 4 Output = `5` instead of `7`**
* **Test Case 5 Output = `4` instead of `5`**

Then it means the **current logic you're using is wrong** — and I'll explain **why it's happening and how to fix it**.

---

## 🔍 First, Let’s Revisit the Test Cases

### ✅ Test Case 4

```python
boxes = [[1,3],[2,4],[3,2],[3,1]]
portsCount = 3
maxBoxes = 3
maxWeight = 7
Expected Output = 7
```

### ✅ Test Case 5

```python
boxes = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
portsCount = 3
maxBoxes = 3
maxWeight = 6
Expected Output = 5
```

---

## ⚠️ Why You’re Getting Incorrect Output

You're likely **not handling “port switches”** or the **return trip (+1)** correctly in your dynamic programming logic.

Let’s look at what should happen:

---

### 📦 Test Case 4 Deep Explanation

```text
Boxes: [1,3], [2,4], [3,2], [3,1]
maxBoxes = 3
maxWeight = 7
```

We want to deliver in **minimum trips** considering:

* 🧳 Weight and box count constraints
* 🚢 Each group of boxes must include all necessary port visits and return to warehouse

Let’s split delivery:

1. First delivery: \[1,3], \[2,4]

   * Port 1 ➝ Port 2 ➝ Return
   * 2 port switches (1 → 2), so trips = 2 + 1 return = **3**

2. Second delivery: \[3,2], \[3,1]

   * One port only → 1 trip + 1 return = **2**

**Total = 3 + 2 = 5**

Wait — that seems to suggest **your output 5 is correct?**

🚨 No! Because this doesn't consider **optimal split.**

The **correct optimal** is:

1. First batch: \[1,3], \[2,4], \[3,2] → weights = 3+4+2 = 9 ❌ over limit

2. So best is: \[1,3], \[2,4] (3+4=7 ✅)

   * Trip: port 1 ➝ port 2 ➝ back = **3 trips**

3. Then: \[3,2], \[3,1] (2+1=3 ✅)

   * Only port 3 involved = **1 trip + return = 2**

**Total = 3 + 2 = 5** — that’s **your output!**

But earlier we said expected output = **7**. So who’s wrong?

👉 Actually, **5 is correct** — previous answer had a wrong expected value!

## 🧠 Final Clarification

### 🟩 Test Case 4

| Batch | Boxes          | Trips                  |
| ----- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1     | \[1,3], \[2,4] | port1→port2→return = 3 |
| 2     | \[3,2], \[3,1] | port3→return = 2       |
|       |                | ✅ Total: **5**         |

✅ Your output is **correct**.

---

### 🟩 Test Case 5

```python
boxes = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
maxWeight = 6
```

* All boxes fit: 1+2+3 = 6 ✅
* Ports: 1 → 2 → 3 → return
* 2 port switches (1→2, 2→3), so 3 trips + 1 return = **4 trips**

✅ Your output of **4** is correct. The expected `5` was wrong earlier.

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

| Test Case | Output | ✅ Verdict |
| --------- | ------ | --------- |
| 4         | 5      | ✅ Correct |
| 5         | 4      | ✅ Correct |

---

## 📌 Updated Expected Outputs

```python
print(boxDelivering([[1,3],[2,4],[3,2],[3,1]], 3, 3, 7))  # ✅ Output: 5
print(boxDelivering([[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]], 3, 3, 6))        # ✅ Output: 4
```
