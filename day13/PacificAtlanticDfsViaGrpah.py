Absolutely! Here's a detailed dry run table showing how cells are marked as reachable by both the **Pacific** and **Atlantic** oceans using DFS traversal:

---

### ðŸŒŠ Problem Overview

- Water can flow from a cell to its neighbor **only if** the neighbor's height is _equal or greater_.
- Pacific touches the **top and left edges**, Atlantic touches the **bottom and right edges**.
- Goal: find cells that can reach **both** oceans.

If you'd like to visualize the visited matrix evolution or animate the DFS waves reaching the oceans, we can turn it into a full-on simulation or even a HackerRank-style challenge with constraints and edge cases. Want to level this up?
