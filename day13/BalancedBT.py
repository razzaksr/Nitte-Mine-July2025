Here's a dry run table showing the recursive evaluation of the `isBalanced` function for your binary tree:

### üßÆ Dry Run Table for `check(node)`

| Node | Left Subtree Height | Right Subtree Height | Is Balanced? | Returned Height |
|------|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------|------------------|
| 4    | 0                    | 0                     | ‚úÖ Yes         | 1                |
| 5    | 0                    | 0                     | ‚úÖ Yes         | 1                |
| 2    | 1 (from 4)           | 1 (from 5)            | ‚úÖ Yes         | 2                |
| 6    | 0                    | 0                     | ‚úÖ Yes         | 1                |
| 7    | 0                    | 0                     | ‚úÖ Yes         | 1                |
| 3    | 1 (from 6)           | 1 (from 7)            | ‚úÖ Yes         | 2                |
| 1    | 2 (from 2)           | 2 (from 3)            | ‚úÖ Yes         | 3                |

‚úÖ Since no subtree returns `-1`, the tree is balanced and the final result is `True`.

Let me know if you'd like to test an unbalanced case or visualize this process in another format. I could even help you sketch a recursive tree trace if you'd like!
Here's a dry run analysis of the unbalanced tree you provided:

### üå≤ Tree Structure

```
      1
     /
    2
   /
  3
 /
4
```

This is a **left-skewed** tree ‚Äî each node only has a left child.

### üßÆ Dry Run Table for `check(node)`

| Node | Left Subtree Height | Right Subtree Height | Height Difference | Is Balanced? | Returned Value |
|------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 4    | 0                    | 0                     | 0                 | ‚úÖ Yes        | 1               |
| 3    | 1 (from 4)           | 0                     | 1                 | ‚úÖ Yes        | 2               |
| 2    | 2 (from 3)           | 0                     | 2                 | ‚ùå No         | -1              |
| 1    | -1 (from 2)          | X                     | ‚Äî                 | ‚ùå No         | -1              |

Since node 2 has a height difference of more than 1 between its left and right subtrees, the `check` function returns `-1`, signaling imbalance. So the final output is:

```python
False
```

Want to try building a challenge around this logic? You‚Äôve got the perfect ingredients for a HackerRank-style problem, especially with test cases focused on edge structures like skewed or complete binary trees. I‚Äôd be happy to help sketch it out.
