# Moderate Programming Concepts - Multiple Choice Questions

## Question 1: Hash Table Applications
What is the primary advantage of using a hash table to solve the "find two numbers that sum to target" problem?

A) It reduces space complexity to O(1)  
B) It eliminates the need for nested loops, reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)  
C) It automatically sorts the input array  
D) It handles duplicate values better than arrays

**Answer: B) It eliminates the need for nested loops, reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)**  
*Explanation: Hash tables provide O(1) average lookup time, allowing us to find complements in a single pass instead of checking all pairs.*

## Question 2: Two-Pointer Technique
In partitioning algorithms, what is the main benefit of using multiple pointers?

A) It increases memory usage for better performance  
B) It allows processing elements from different positions simultaneously  
C) It automatically handles edge cases  
D) It makes the code more readable

**Answer: B) It allows processing elements from different positions simultaneously**  
*Explanation: Multiple pointers enable efficient in-place operations by tracking different regions or states in the array simultaneously.*

## Question 3: Dynamic Programming vs Greedy
What distinguishes a greedy algorithm from dynamic programming?

A) Greedy algorithms always give optimal solutions  
B) Dynamic programming uses more memory  
C) Greedy makes locally optimal choices at each step without reconsidering  
D) Dynamic programming is always faster

**Answer: C) Greedy makes locally optimal choices at each step without reconsidering**  
*Explanation: Greedy algorithms make the best choice at each step without looking back, while DP considers all possible solutions.*

## Question 4: In-Place Array Modification
What does "in-place" modification mean in array algorithms?

A) Modifying the array using extra space equal to input size  
B) Modifying the array without using additional space proportional to input size  
C) Creating a new array with modifications  
D) Sorting the array first

**Answer: B) Modifying the array without using additional space proportional to input size**  
*Explanation: In-place algorithms modify the input data structure directly, using only constant extra space.*

## Question 5: Prefix Sum Technique
When is the prefix sum technique most useful?

A) When you need to sort an array  
B) When you need to answer multiple range sum queries efficiently  
C) When you need to find the maximum element  
D) When you need to reverse an array

**Answer: B) When you need to answer multiple range sum queries efficiently**  
*Explanation: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(n) preprocessing, making multiple queries very efficient.*

## Question 6: Optimal Substructure
What does "optimal substructure" mean in algorithm design?

A) The algorithm uses the minimum amount of memory  
B) An optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems  
C) The algorithm has the best time complexity  
D) The code structure is well-organized

**Answer: B) An optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems**  
*Explanation: Optimal substructure means that optimal solutions to larger problems can be constructed from optimal solutions to smaller subproblems.*

## Question 7: Sliding Window vs Two Pointers
What is the key difference between sliding window and two-pointer techniques?

A) Sliding window only works on sorted arrays  
B) Two pointers always move in opposite directions  
C) Sliding window maintains a contiguous subarray, two pointers can be anywhere  
D) They are exactly the same technique

**Answer: C) Sliding window maintains a contiguous subarray, two pointers can be anywhere**  
*Explanation: Sliding window focuses on contiguous subarrays/substrings, while two pointers can be positioned anywhere based on the problem requirements.*

## Question 8: Greedy Choice Property
In problems where greedy algorithms work, what must be true?

A) The input must be sorted  
B) Making locally optimal choices leads to a globally optimal solution  
C) The problem must have overlapping subproblems  
D) Dynamic programming must also work

**Answer: B) Making locally optimal choices leads to a globally optimal solution**  
*Explanation: For greedy algorithms to work correctly, the greedy choice property must hold - local optimization leads to global optimization.*

---

## Question 9: Space-Time Tradeoffs
What is a common space-time tradeoff in algorithm design?

A) Using more memory to reduce time complexity  
B) Using more time to reduce memory usage  
C) Both A and B are valid tradeoffs  
D) Space and time are never related

**Answer: C) Both A and B are valid tradeoffs**  
*Explanation: We can often trade space for time (like using hash tables for faster lookups) or time for space (like recomputing values instead of storing them).*

---

## Question 10: Interval Processing
When working with intervals, what is typically the first step in most algorithms?

A) Find the maximum interval  
B) Sort intervals by their start or end points  
C) Count the number of intervals  
D) Find overlapping intervals

**Answer: B) Sort intervals by their start or end points**  
*Explanation: Sorting intervals by start or end points is usually the first step as it enables efficient processing of overlaps and merges.*
